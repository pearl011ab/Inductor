# Lab 4 – Inductor Project  

## Overview  
This repository contains the files, documentation, and simulation from Lab 4.  
The lab focused on the inductor — its properties, functions, and real-world applications.

## What is an Inductor?  
An inductor is a passive component that stores energy in the form of a magnetic field when current flows through it.  

- Symbol: `L`  
- Unit: Henry (H)  
- Key Relation:  
  \[
  V = L \frac{di}{dt}
  \]  

This means an inductor opposes sudden changes in current.

## Project Description  
### Title: Simulation of an RLC Circuit (Lab 4)  

**Steps I followed:**  
1. Designed the circuit in Proteus (Resistor + Inductor + Capacitor).  
2. Added measurement instruments (oscilloscope, ammeter, voltmeter).  
3. Connected a 12 V DC/AC power source.  
4. Ran the simulation and observed inductor behavior.  
5. Pushed project files to GitHub for version control.
